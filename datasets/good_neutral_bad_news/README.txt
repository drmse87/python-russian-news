Perform the web scraping of the Good, Neutral or Bad news articles, and then place the scraped files here in the following subdirectories:

/neg (for files starting with 2)
/neutral (for files starting with 3)
/pos (for files starting with 1)

Also, make sure that no files are empty or filled with invalid data such as a HTTP 404 response or GDPR/cookie messages (if so, manually extract the article content).
