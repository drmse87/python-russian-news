A REPORT HAS compared prostitution and human trafficking in six EU member states has found criminalising those who buy sex and decriminalising those in prostitution, is the best way to end demand. The report , looks at the different approaches of six EU member states, including Ireland towards tackling human trafficking and its links to prostitution. The results corroborate other studies that points towards tackling demand for buying sex to decrease human trafficking. “Demand is threefold,” says Monica O’Connor, co-founder of Sexual Exploitation Research Project UCD and author of the report. “The demand of buyers; the demand in relation to the figures in the sex-buying industry (the women and girls, the prostitution organisers, and the pimps); the demand by traffickers to move women both nationally and internationally.” “Increasing awareness at EU level at buyers and criminalisation of buyers,” she added. The majority of those in prostitution in Ireland are women and girls; Irish authorities have recently reported an increase in suspected victims of trafficking from Nigeria (some related to upheavals from Boko Haram attacking villages), Romania, Brazil and Pakistan.  Report The report examines Cyprus, Finland, Sweden, Lithuania, France and Ireland. Among the comparisons in the report, is that most countries were a “destination” country for trafficked girls and women – Lithuania was the only “origin” country. Observers estimate 40% of identified Lithuanian trafficking victims are women and girls subjected to sex trafficking within the country, as well as in Western Europe and Scandinavia. The report said: Ireland recently moved towards a model of criminalising buying sex, but decriminalising those in prostitution. But O’Connor says that the report raises the question of “where do we move from that” and highlights a need to focus on support services so that girls who want to leave prostitution can do so. In general, women who have been trafficked for prostitution are young and from impoverished regions in the world. They’re also transported from impoverished regions in the EU, with traffickers using the migration flows already there. “The sex industry is present and thriving in every county in Ireland,” the report says, “it is a highly gendered phenomenon and there are clearly interconnections between prostitution and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.” In 2009 alone, 51 nationalities were identified in Ireland in prostitution. O’Connor says that you would see the same vulnerability, poverty, gender inequality, and opportunistic exploitation of a child or young women no matter their country of origin. “There are still some Irish women in prostitution in Ireland, mostly on the streets, drug-addicted,” she added. #Open journalism No news is bad news Support The Journal Your contributions will help us continue

You’re only in a location for a short period of time, with no time to reach out or have a connection to others or to Ireland.” This is apart from when there’s big events such as a sporting event or stag nights. Despite decriminalisation of those who sell sex, O’Connor says that the challenge now is to ensure women “have ways out”. You can read the report here.
