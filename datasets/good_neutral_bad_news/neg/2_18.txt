Atum, also known as the 'great he-she' was the solar creator god of ancient Egypt.

The inscription claims that it was God Atum who was responsible for flooding the river Nile in the late Period, from 664-332BC.

Archaeologists from the Antiquities Ministry hope the discovery will attract more visitors to the area.
