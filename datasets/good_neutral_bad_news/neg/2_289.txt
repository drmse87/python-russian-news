BBC confirms the Eurovision selection process is changing next year Eurovision: You Decide will return in February 2019.  Eurovision might feel like a long way off, but fans of the annual song contest should know that there's a change on the way. The BBC has confirmed that it is giving the selection process an "overhaul" ahead of the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest in Tel Aviv, Israel. In the past, the annual Eurovision: You Decide contest , which is hosted by Mel Giedroyc and Måns Zelmerlöw, has seen six hopefuls battle it out to represent the UK in the main competition.    This time, three songs, chosen by an international jury, will be performed in two different styles by two different artists. Only one act from each pair will make it through to the final public vote, the BBC notes. "Our exciting 'euro-version' format will give fans the chance to compare and contrast these fantastic songs in a fresh, new way and deliver the United Kingdom the artist it deserves to fly the flag out in Tel Aviv," Eurovision: You Decide's executive producer Mel Balac commented. The 2019 You Decide show will be broadcast on BBC Two in February before the final takes places on 18 May.  Last year, the eventual winner of the competition was Israel's Netta , who topped the leaderboard with 529 points. SuRie, the UK's entry, was in third-bottom with just 23 points, after an eventful performance. The singer's rendition of 'Storm' was interrupted by an unknown stage invader who grabbed her microphone half-way through the song. SuRie powered on through, and although she was given the chance to repeat her performance, she turned it down. Good luck to all the potential entries for 2019.
