COMPELLING CONTENT: WHAT WE WRITE ABOUT Digital requires news organizations to be fast. Information is spreading instantly in the digital ocean, and sometimes not being there at the right time is not being there at all. News, Features and Analysis, The Times of Israel has it all But a significant journalistic identity also requires depth. The long reads, the features, the analysis are crucial in shaping the journalistic product, singling it out from the abundance of voices out there. As a digital-only product, Times of Israel had to learn to satisfy both these needs simultaneously. Here are some of its successes: Bridging the gulf between Israel and Diaspora Jewry With Amanda Borschel-Dan at the helm of Times of Israelâs Jewish Times coverage, ToI has kept Israel and the Diaspora informed and able to grapple with the crises surrounding the frozen Western Wall compromise deal, the disputes over conversion, and the other hot-button issues that will determine how well the global Jewish people can work together in the years ahead. With a spotlight on the Western Wall, is this Israelâs Reform moment? Ongoing analysis of the ever-complex Israeli reality It is the rare journalist who can maintain an objective perspective even while zooming in on the nation’s burning issues, but founding editor David Horovitz consistently manages this as he shares his hard-won insights on the pages of The Times of Israel. With interviews, analyses and op-eds, Horovitz writes wit-peppered articles in which he highlights many of the questions and challenges that affect Israel and the Jewish World today. Foxman after Pittsburgh: Trump is a demagogue, a threat to democracy and Jews Corbyn, who sought Israelâs demise, is an anti-Semite. Labour must kick him out How Netanyahu turned victory into all-around defeat in African migrant crisis Exposing and closing the global binary options scam Simona Weinglass In a series of investigative reports over the course of two years, Simona Weinglass brought the binary option scam, operated mainly from Israel, to global attention. As a direct result of The Times of Israelâs journalistic campaign against the fraud, the Knesset passed a law which banned the industry outright, giving the binary options fraudsters three months to close down their operations or face up to two years in jail. The wolves of Tel Aviv: Israelâs vast, amoral binary options scam exposed Israel bans binary options industry, finally closing vast, 10-year fraud Oustanding coverage of Israelâs booming High Tech scene Start-Up Israel is The Times of Israel’s dedicated site for the dramatic innovations produced here that are changing the world. It tells the story of the Start-Up Nation, covering environmental technology, cybersecurity, medical developments, water technology, the business of start-ups, VCs and angels, high-tech education, and much more.
