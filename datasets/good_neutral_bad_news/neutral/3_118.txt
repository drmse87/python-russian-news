Cape Coral woman arrested for DUI after allegedly driving through mailboxes

CAPE CORAL, Fla. – A Cape Coral woman was arrested after driving drunk and pummeling down multiple mailboxes.

Lee County deputies arrested 39-year-old Crystal Kolakowski for DUI, hit and run and resisting an officer on Friday night.

Deputies received multiple reports of a reckless driver driving without headlights on Pine Island Road.

That’s where deputies found Kolakowski in her green Honda. At first, she wouldn’t pull over for deputies.

Meanwhile, Lee County deputies were also responding to SW 20th Avenue after getting reports of six mailboxes being damaged. When they arrived, they found debris all over the road, including parts of Kolakowski’s Honda.

Deputies arrested Kolakowski and she tried to run away, at one point slipping out of her handcuffs. Deputies had to pin her to the ground and tase her to get her back in custody.

She has since bonded out of jail.

Kolakowski’s mother said Kolakowski has an attorney, but could not comment any further.

Kolakowski is facing multiple charges including DUI, hit-and-run and resisting an officer.
