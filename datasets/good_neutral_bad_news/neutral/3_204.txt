Eating junk food raises the risk of becoming depressed, a new study reveals.

Researchers in Britain, Spain and Australia analyzed data from 41 multi-country studies, finding unhealthy foods to be linked with chronic inflammation associated with developing clinical depression.

Processed foods high in fat lead to inflammation across the digestive system, eventually traveling to the brain and affecting neurotransmitters in charge of regulating your mood.

This systematic inflammation has similar effects on the body as obesity, pollution and lack of exercise, according to the studyâ€™s authors.

Following this new research, health officials overseas are encouraged to give dietary advice to patients facing depression and other mental health issues.

In America, nearly 16.2 million adults have had at least one major depressive episode in a given year.
