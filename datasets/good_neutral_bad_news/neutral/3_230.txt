  Indians held captive in Ethiopia over unpaid salaries  Seven Indian nationals are being held captive in western Ethiopia by local workers demanding their salaries, media reports say. The seven work for an Indian firm building roads in Ethiopia. Local staff have allegedly held the seven for the last five days because they had not been paid salaries, the Ethiopia Observer reported. One of the seven, Chaitanya Hari, was quoted by India's The Hindu newspaper as saying: "The safety situation is getting worse day by day. In our camp, Indians are not allowed to go outside to bring food, water and other essential items. The local people fear that once we leave the camp, they will not get their salaries.”  Most Popular Nyanza senator planning to ditch ODM for Kanu Tigray crisis: 'We're the State, we know what you're doing' Meghan Markle considered suicide while a British royal Mute your mike to chat with your lover Digital card of Raila dressed as a witch doctor altered Latest Videos Nominated Senator denies involvement in Kabuchai by-election chaos MP Osoro surrenders to police over by-election chaos in Kisii Sign up for the free Star email newsletter and receive the latest Kenya news daily.
