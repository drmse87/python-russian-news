Marriott Hotels Discloses Security Breach Affecting Up To 500-Million Guests

Marriott Hotels has announced a major security breach involving their Starwood guest reservation database affecting up to 500-million guests dating back to 2014.

Marriott says for about 327-million of those guests, information includes names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, emails, passport numbers and credit card information.

“For some, the information also includes payment card numbers and payment card expiration dates, but the payment card numbers were encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard encryption (AES-128). There are two components needed to decrypt the payment card numbers, and at this point, Marriott has not been able to rule out the possibility that both were taken.”

Marriott says the only Starwood hotel in the St. John’s area is the the Sheraton.

Marriott says an investigation found that there was unauthorized access to the database with contained guest information related to reservations at Starwood properties on or before September 10, 2018.

The company issued a release today that they received an alert September 8, 2018 that an attempt to access the Starwood guest reservation database in US had been made. Marriott says it learned during the investigation that there had been unauthorized access to the Starwood network since 2014. The unauthorized party had copied and encrypted information, and on November 19, Marriott was able to decrypt the information and determined it was from their Starwood guest reservation database.

Starwood includes Sheraton Hotels and Resorts, Westin Hotels and Resorts as well as hotels under the names of W Hotels, St. Regis, Element Hotels, Aloft Hotels, The Luxury Collection, Tribute Portfolio, Le Méridien Hotels & Resorts, Four Points by Sheraton and Design Hotels. Starwood-branded timeshare properties are also included.
