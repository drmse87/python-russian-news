KUALA LUMPUR: Muhammad Adib Mohd Kassim, the fireman who was gravely injured in the Sri Maha Mariamman Temple fracas, is showing signs of waking up and responding to some verbal commands at the National Heart Institute (IJN) here where he is being treated.

In the latest update on his condition, IJN said that the 24-year-old was still being kept highly sedated to allow his organs to recover.

“Adib continues to show signs of improvement.

“He is less dependent on medication for his heart, the oxygen settings for the ECMO machine have been lessened but he still requires full support for his kidney.

“He is currently on a medically-induced comatose condition,” it said in a statement.

In summing up his condition, IJN said the firefighter remained critical but stable with signs of improvement.

IJN physiotherapists would today start passive physiotherapy support as part of Adib’s cardiopulmonary rehabilitation.

Inspector-General of Police Mohamad Fuzi Harun earlier today confirmed that Adib was assaulted and not hit by a fire engine as claimed by some.
