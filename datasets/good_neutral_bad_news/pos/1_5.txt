 Accessibility Links Bill Gates puts up $400m for safer sanitation Bill Gates aims to save 500,000 young lives a year by reinventing the lavatory for the world’s poorest. The billionaire founder of Microsoft has pledged $400 million from his charitable foundation to introduce sanitation to developing countries. Sponsored Mr Gates opened a three-day conference in Beijing yesterday, the Reinvented Toilet Expo, to show designs that break down human waste without the need for sewage systems and treatment plants. “Getting rid of that waste is key to human health,” he said, adding that in the west “it all gets cleared up and we take that for granted”. He declared that “today we are on the cusp of a sanitation revolution” and promised the most significant advances in the field for almost 200 years.
