US designates son of Hezbollah leader as ‘global terrorist’ The US State Department declares Jawad Nasrallah, the son of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, as a “global terrorist” as it steps up pressure on the Lebanese group. It calls Jawad a “rising leader” of the group who had in recent years recruited people “to carry out terrorist attacks against Israel in the West Bank.” The State Department also maintains its 21-year-old “Foreign Terrorist Organization” designation of Hezbollah, as the group battles prime minister-designate Saad al-Hariri for a powerful role in the new Lebanese government. — AFP Gazans flood streets for ‘victory marches’ after truce with Israel said reached Hours after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas terrorist group reportedly went into effect, thousands of Gaza residents are celebrating reported truce with “victory marches” across the Strip, according to Hadashot news. Leaders of the Hamas terrorist group praise the barrage of rockets fired into Israel over the last 24 hours, and say that resuming the Egyptian-brokered ceasefire after the major escalation is a major military victory. “Our rockets have pounded Israel and sent a clear message: Bomb for bomb, blood for blood,” Hamas official Ismail Radwan says according to Hadashot news. “If you attack Gaza and our people, Hamas rockets will find you everywhere, in Haifa, Jaffa, Ashkelon and Ashdod.” Hamas praises ceasefire mediators for stopping ‘Zionist aggression’ Hamas is thanking mediators from Egypt, Norway, Qatar, and the United Nations for helping broker a ceasefire deal with Israel after a severe major of violence threatened to descend into full-blown war. In a statement, the ruling terror group says that while armed groups were “heroically” fighting “Zionist aggression” over the last 24 hours, international mediators worked tirelessly to reach another truce with Israel. “Hamas expresses its appreciation for these valued efforts, especially the persistent Egyptian role, the UN efforts and the Norwegian and Qatari roles,” the group says in statement. Opposition leaders slam Netanyahu over reported truce with Hamas The leaders of the Zionist Union and Yesh Atid are criticizing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for reportedly agreeing to a ceasefire agreement with Hamas following a major flare up in violence over the last 24 hours. Livni calls the apparent decision to abide by the terms of the Egyptian-brokered truce “a colossal security failure on the part of the right-wing government,” and says the move dealt a “fatal blow to Israel’s deterrence.” “Tonight it was made clear that the Right has no solution to security, but we do,” Livni says in a statement. “We put it on the table four years ago, and now it needs to be implemented.” Labor leader Avi Gabbay also levels harsh criticism against Netanyahu, saying that his government’s policy regarding Hamas has failed the residents of Israel. “For four years, Netanyahu has abandoned residents of the periphery and neglected the issues in Gaza,” he says in a statement. “The residents of southern Israel shouldn’t have to hear about the ceasefire from Al Jazeera, they deserve genuine leadership that is prepared to look them in the eye and tell them the truth,” Gabbay says. PA official: Egypt trying to convince Israel to accept Gaza truce The Palestinian UN ambassador says Egyptian mediators are in Israel trying to get the government to agree on a Gaza cease-fire. Riyad Mansour, who represents the Western-backed Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, tells reporters at UN headquarters in New York that “we are grateful for the Egyptians who are mediating.” The Gaza-based terrorist group Hamas says it agreed to the Egyptian cease-fire proposal. There has been no official word yet from Israel, though a minister indicated that Israel agreed to the truce. Mansour says “the Palestinian side is holding the quietness in order to allow for the Egyptian efforts to succeed.” He says Abbas is returning from Kuwait for emergency meetings. Mansour accuses Israel of starting the cycle of violence with a botched undercover military operation on Sunday. At the Palestinians’ request, he says, Kuwait and Bolivia have asked for a meeting of the UN Security Council on the Israeli actions. China, the current council president, has called for closed consultations later today. — AP Security restrictions removed in south as uncertain calm sets in The IDF Home Front Command removes all restrictions on residents of southern Israel as an uneasy ceasefire with the Hamas terror group appeared to hold, the army says. Schools will be reopened on Wednesday, as will all business and government offices. Farmers will again be allowed to work in their fields. — Judah Ari Gross Polls close in tense round 2 of Jerusalem municipal elections Polls closed tonight at 10 p.m. in the tense Jerusalem mayoral runoff between candidates Moshe Lion and Ofer Berkovitch, with turnout rates in the capital reported at a mere 26.3 percent, in a race largely overshadowed by an outbreak of violence in southern Israel. According to the Interior Ministry, as of 9:45 p.m., just over one quarter of eligible Jerusalem residents â168,000 of 638,000 â had exercised their right to pick their next mayor. A second round of municipal voting was held today in 54 cities, towns, and regional councils â areas in which no single candidate garnered at least 40% of the vote on October 30. The preliminary results are expected to trickle in overnight, with a final count anticipated tomorrow. — Marissa Newman IDF: Bus hit by anti-tank missile was near Gaza border against protocol A preliminary IDF investigation finds that the bus that was struck by an anti-tank missile fired from the Gaza Strip should not have been so close to the border. According to reports, the soldiers asked the driver to take them inside the Black Arrow memorial site in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, against army regulations. The bus was parked at the site in full view of the Gaza border, and dozens of soldiers had just disembarked when the anti-tank guided missile struck the vehicle. The strike on the bus left a 19-year-old soldier in critical condition. The bus driver was also injured in the attack. State Department condemns ‘unacceptable’ rocket fire from Gaza The US State Department says it stands with Israel as it defends itself against the barrage of rockets and mortars fired into Israel by armed groups in the Gaza Strip. âWe condemn in the strongest terms the rocket, missile, and mortar attacks that are taking place from Gaza into Israel,â State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert says at press conference. âWe call for the sustained halt of those attacks. We stand with Israel as Israel defends itself against these attacks. It is simply unacceptable to target civilians.â Earlier, Gaza terrorist groups announced an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire with Israel after a severe escalation of violence threatened to descend into full-blown war.
